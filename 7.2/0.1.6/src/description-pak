Snappy was developed to reduce network traffic with neglectable overhead on the node.
 It is therefor quiet fast (to decompress) with a reasonable compression ratio. The developer states [2-4x for HTML data](http://code.google.com/p/snappy/source/browse/trunk/README) for example.
 Note that snappy is optimised for 64bit architectures and speed benchmarks are usally supplied for that.
 At the time of writing no streaming service is known to use snappy on the fly.
 With PHP it is possible to couple snappy with memcached services. But beware of the decompression times on serialised php data.
 Combined with [igbinary](http://pecl.php.net/package/igbinary) it seems to provide acceptable performance and compression ratio.
